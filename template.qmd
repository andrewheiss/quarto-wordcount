: Here's a table with a caption that doesn't get counted

::: {.no-count}

### No counting

You can use the `{.no-count}` class on a [fenced div](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html#sec-divs-and-spans) to skip counting its contents, like this section.

::: 

### Shortcodes

Word counts can be directly included in your document with shortcodes, like so:[^1]

- Use `{{{< words-total >}}}` to include a count of all words: **{{< words-total >}} words**

- Use `{{{< words-body >}}}` to include a count of the words in the text body only, omitting the references, notes, and appendix: **{{< words-body >}} words**

- Use `{{{< words-ref >}}}` to include a count of the words in the reference section: **{{< words-ref >}} words**

- Use `{{{< words-append >}}}` to include a count of the words in the appendix, which must be wrapped in a div with the `#appendix-count` id (see below for an example): **{{< words-append >}} words**

- Use `{{{< words-note >}}}` to include a count of the words in the notes: **{{< words-note >}} words**. You can also reliably count words in the footnotes which would have previously been included in whichever section they were.[^2]

- Use `{{{< words-sum ARG >}}}` where `ARG` is some concatenation of the four countable areas: `body`, `ref`, `append`, and `note`. For example, `{{{< words-sum body-note >}}}` includes a count of the words in the body and notes (**{{< words-sum body-note >}} words**); `{{{< words-sum ref-append >}}}` includes a count of the words in the references and appendix (**{{< words-sum ref-append >}} words**)

[^1]: **NOTE** shortcodes `{{{< words-body >}}}`, `{{{< words-ref >}}}`, `{{{< words-append >}}}`, and `{{{< words-note >}}}` do not overlap their counts.

[^2]: Count footnote words with `{{{< words-note >}}}`: {{< words-note >}}


### Minor issues with shortcode counting

This filter may not always produce accurate counts for documents that use shortcodes, specifically shortcodes that run after this filter. If a shortcode has multiple arguments but only returns one word, then it is possible that the word count is inflated,[^3] and conversely deflated if it returns more words.

[^3]: An example in this extension is `{{{< words-sum ARG >}}}`, where `ARG` is formatted as "ref-note" or "body-append", etc., to count specific sections together. Since `words-sum` has two words to construct the shortcode but only one word is returned, the region that uses this shortcode is inflated by one.
