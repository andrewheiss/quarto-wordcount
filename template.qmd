## Introduction

::: {.no-count}

You may use the `{.no-count}` class on a div to skip counting its contents, like this sentence.

: Here's a table with a caption that doesn't get counted

Word counts can now be directly included with short codes. For example, use {{{< words-body >}}} to include body word count: {{< words-body >}}, or {{{< words-total >}}} to include all words tallied by this filter: {{< words-total >}}.[^1] You can also reliably count words in the footnotes which would have previously been included in whichever section they were.[^2]

[^1]: **NOTE** short codes {{{< words-body >}}}, {{{< words-ref >}}}, {{{< words-append >}}}, and {{{< words-note >}}} do not overlap their counts.

[^2]: Count Footnotes words with {{{< words-note >}}}: {{< words-note >}}

This filter may not always produce accurate counts for documents that use short codes, specifically short codes that run after this filter. If a shortcode has multiple arguments but only return one word, then it is possible that the word count is inflated,[^3] and conversely deflated if it spawns more words.


[^3]: An example in this extension is {{{< words-sum ARG >}}}, where `ARG` is formatted as "ref-note" or "body-append", etc, to count specific sections together. Since `words-sum` has two words to construct the short code but only one word is returned, the region that uses this short code is inflated by 1.
